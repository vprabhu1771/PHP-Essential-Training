The `php -r` command allows you to run PHP code directly from the command line without needing to create a PHP file. This is useful for quickly testing small snippets of PHP code. 

Here's the basic syntax:


php -r 'your_php_code_here;'


For example, if you want to print "Hello, World!" using PHP, you can use the following command:


php -r "echo 'Hello, World!\n';"


This will output:

Hello, World!
